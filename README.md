## Tech Stach & Concepts
* Tech-stack
    * [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.
    * [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - perform background operations.
    * [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) - handle the stream of data asynchronously that executes sequentially.
    * [Dagger hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - a pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework.
    * [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
        * [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - a persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite.
        * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - is an observable data holder.
        * [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - perform action when lifecycle state changes.
        * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
