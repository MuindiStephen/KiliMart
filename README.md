# KiliMart
Consuming [FAKE STORE API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to demonstrate online shop store.Built this app using the MVVM architecture, Kotlin Flows, (Uni-directional data flow), dagger hilt, viewmodel, Room  and Kotlin coroutines.

## App General preview
 - Updated demos coming soon


## Tech Stach & Concepts
- 
    * [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.
    * [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - perform background operations.
    * [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) - handle the stream of data asynchronously that executes sequentially.
    * [Dagger hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - a pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework.
    - [Logging Interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/README.md) -  logs HTTP requests and responses data messages and lines and their headers based on their level
    - [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture)- MVVM stands for Model, View, ViewModel. Model: This holds the data of the application. It cannot directly talk to the View. Generally, it's recommended to expose the data to the ViewModel through Observables.
        - [Room database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit) -  Retrofit is a REST client for Java/ Kotlin and Android by Square inc under Apache 2.0 license. Its a simple network library that is used for network transactions. By using this library we can seamlessly capture JSON response from web service/web API.
- [GSON](https://github.com/square/gson) - JSON Parser,used to parse requests on the data layer for Entities and understands Kotlin non-nullable and default parameters.
- [Network bound resource]() - An algorithm that provides an easy function to fetch resource from both database and network
    * [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
        * [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - a persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite.
        * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - is an observable data holder.
        * [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - perform action when lifecycle state changes.
        * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
